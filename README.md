# Lineage Atlas Landing Page

This is a static HTML/CSS landing page. You can run it locally with any static file server,
or open the HTML file directly in a browser.

## Quick start (no server)

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Run with a local server (recommended)

Using Python:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000

## Notes

- The page uses a Google Font (`Manrope`). If you are offline, the browser will fall back to
  system fonts automatically.
